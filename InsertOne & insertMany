# MongoDB `insertOne` Method

The `insertOne` method in MongoDB is used to insert a single document (or record) into a MongoDB collection. This method is commonly used when you need to add a new document to a collection. The inserted document can be in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is MongoDB's native data format.

## Basic Syntax

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne(document)

# MongoDB Write Concern Options

In MongoDB, write concern options allow you to control how write operations are confirmed as successful. These options are crucial for ensuring data integrity and durability, especially in a distributed database environment.

## `w` (Write Concern)

The `w` option specifies the number of nodes that must acknowledge a write operation before it's considered successful. You can set it as an integer or to "majority."

- An integer value, e.g., `w: 1`, means that at least one node must acknowledge the write.
- Setting `w: "majority"` means that a majority of the nodes in the replica set must acknowledge the write.

By default, MongoDB often uses `w: 1`, which requires acknowledgment from one node.

## `j` (Journaling)

The `j` option determines whether the write operation should be journaled before being acknowledged as successful. Journaling ensures data durability, even in the event of a server crash.

- `j: true` means that the write operation must be successfully written to the journal (on disk) before acknowledgment.
- Omitting or setting `j: false` means that MongoDB does not wait for the write operation to be journaled and considers it successful once it's written to memory.

Journaling adds data durability but can introduce some latency.

## `wtimeout` (Write Timeout)

The `wtimeout` option sets a time limit (in milliseconds) for a write operation to complete successfully, considering the write concern specified by `w`.

- If the write operation doesn't complete within the specified time, it's considered unsuccessful, and an error is returned.

Here's an example of using these options in a MongoDB write operation:

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne(
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    age: 30
  },
  {
    writeConcern: {
      w: "majority",
      j: true,
      wtimeout: 5000 // Wait up to 5 seconds for acknowledgment
    }
  }
);

Certainly, here's the content formatted as a GitHub README.md file for MongoDB's `insertMany` method:

# MongoDB `insertMany` Method

In MongoDB, the `insertMany` method is used to insert multiple documents (or records) into a MongoDB collection in a single operation. This method is useful when you need to insert multiple documents efficiently.

## Basic Syntax

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertMany(documents)
```

- `db`: Refers to the MongoDB database where the collection is located.
- `collectionName`: Specifies the name of the collection where you want to insert the documents.
- `documents`: An array of JSON-like or BSON-like documents that you want to insert into the collection. Each document in the array should adhere to the structure and schema of the collection. MongoDB's flexible schema allows for variations within the same collection.

## Example

Let's demonstrate how to use `insertMany` to insert multiple documents into a "products" collection:

```javascript
db.products.insertMany([
  {
    name: "Product A",
    price: 19.99,
    category: "Electronics"
  },
  {
    name: "Product B",
    price: 29.99,
    category: "Clothing"
  },
  {
    name: "Product C",
    price: 9.99,
    category: "Home and Garden"
  }
])
```

In this example, we're inserting an array of documents, each representing a product, into the "products" collection.

## Acknowledgment

The `insertMany` method returns an acknowledgment indicating whether the insertion was successful and provides information about the inserted documents, including their unique identifiers (`_id`) if they were not provided in the documents.

Here's an example of the acknowledgment:

```javascript
{
  acknowledged: true,
  insertedIds: [
    ObjectId("5f4e5665b4b7d8c9f72f3fb0"),
    ObjectId("5f4e5665b4b7d8c9f72f3fb1"),
    ObjectId("5f4e5665b4b7d8c9f72f3fb2")
  ]
}
```

In this example, `acknowledged` is `true`, indicating that the insertion was successful, and `insertedIds` contains the automatically generated `_id` values for the newly inserted documents.

## Note

- `insertMany` is efficient for bulk insertions of multiple documents.
- Each document in the array is inserted as an individual record.
- The `insertMany` operation either inserts all documents successfully or none at all. If any document in the array encounters an error during insertion, the entire operation is rolled back.

This information should help you understand how to use the `insertMany` method effectively in MongoDB for inserting multiple documents at once.
