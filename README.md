# MongoDB `insertOne` Method

The `insertOne` method in MongoDB is used to insert a single document (or record) into a MongoDB collection. This method is commonly used when you need to add a new document to a collection. The inserted document can be in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is MongoDB's native data format.

## Basic Syntax

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne(document)

# MongoDB Write Concern Options

In MongoDB, write concern options allow you to control how write operations are confirmed as successful. These options are crucial for ensuring data integrity and durability, especially in a distributed database environment.

## `w` (Write Concern)

The `w` option specifies the number of nodes that must acknowledge a write operation before it's considered successful. You can set it as an integer or to "majority."

- An integer value, e.g., `w: 1`, means that at least one node must acknowledge the write.
- Setting `w: "majority"` means that a majority of the nodes in the replica set must acknowledge the write.

By default, MongoDB often uses `w: 1`, which requires acknowledgment from one node.

## `j` (Journaling)

The `j` option determines whether the write operation should be journaled before being acknowledged as successful. Journaling ensures data durability, even in the event of a server crash.

- `j: true` means that the write operation must be successfully written to the journal (on disk) before acknowledgment.
- Omitting or setting `j: false` means that MongoDB does not wait for the write operation to be journaled and considers it successful once it's written to memory.

Journaling adds data durability but can introduce some latency.

## `wtimeout` (Write Timeout)

The `wtimeout` option sets a time limit (in milliseconds) for a write operation to complete successfully, considering the write concern specified by `w`.

- If the write operation doesn't complete within the specified time, it's considered unsuccessful, and an error is returned.

Here's an example of using these options in a MongoDB write operation:

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne(
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    age: 30
  },
  {
    writeConcern: {
      w: "majority",
      j: true,
      wtimeout: 5000 // Wait up to 5 seconds for acknowledgment
    }
  }
);
